# Learning Projects

I made this account to upload and keep track of things I've done while learning python.


Much of this was learned from tips from UDEMY courses in Python and Ethical Hacking

1. The Network Scanner uses ARP Requests to scan for devices and MAC Addresses on a network

2. The MAC Address Changer is a simple program which takes user input to change the device's MAC Addresss to whatever the user specifies

3. Scanner.Py is a port scanner which checks for common open ports on a device

4. The ARP Spoofer uses ARP return packets to spoof a router in order to initiate a Man in the Middle attack.    It was a bit of a challenge so right now you have to input your target IPs into the code, rather than the    command line. 

5. The packet sniffer listens for HTTP Requests on Port 80 and will alert when HTTP Requests occur
   and when a possible login may have occured
